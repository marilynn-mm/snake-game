# Project Description 

This project is a Java-based adaptation of the classic Snake game, featuring both manual and AI-controlled gameplay. Built on an existing codebase, the game enhances the traditional experience with graphical rendering, user input handling, and advanced game mechanics such as AI-driven movement and snake reversal.

The project involved:

- Integrating AI Mode: Implemented an autonomous snake movement system that dynamically responds to the game environment.
- Enhanced Game Logic: Developed modular functions to handle snake behavior, collision detection, and movement reversal.
- Graphical Rendering & UI: Improved the visual experience by optimizing rendering and user feedback mechanisms.
- Codebase Adaptation: Analyzed and extended an existing structure with efficient, well-organized functions.

The final product is a fully interactive, scalable game that demonstrates effective problem-solving, AI-driven decision-making, and the ability to work within and extend an existing codebase.
